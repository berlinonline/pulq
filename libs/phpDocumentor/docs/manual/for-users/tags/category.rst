@category
==========

The @category tag is used to organize groups of packages together but is
deprecated in favour of occupying the top-level with the @package tag.
As such usage of this tag is NOT RECOMMENDED.

Syntax
------

    @category [description]

Description
-----------

The @category tag was meant in the original de-facto Standard to group several
:term:`Structural Elements` their :doc:`package` tags into one category. These
categories could then be used to aid in the generation of API documentation.

This was necessary since the @package tag, as defined in the original Standard, did
not contain more then one hierarchy level; since this has changed this tag SHOULD
NOT be used.

Please see the documentation for :doc:`package` for details of its usage.

This tag MUST NOT occur more than once in a :term:`DocBlock`.

Effects in phpDocumentor
-----------------------

The @category tag has no significant effect in phpDocumentor. It will be shown with
the description information of associated :term:`Structural Elements` and is
inherited by classes and interfaces.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: php
   :linenos:

    /**
     * Page-Level DocBlock
     *
     * @category MyCategory
     * @package  MyPackage
     */
