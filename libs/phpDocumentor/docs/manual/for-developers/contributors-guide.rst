Contributor's Guidelines
========================

Introduction
------------

phpDocumentor aims to be a high quality Documentation Generation
Application (DGA) but at the same time wants to give contributors
freedom when submitting fixes or improvements.

As such we want to *encourage* but not obligate you, the
contributor, to follow these guidelines. The only exception to this
are the guidelines regarding *Github usage and branching* to
prevent ``merge-hell``.

Having said that: I do really appreciate it when you apply the
guidelines in part or wholly.

Github Usage & Branching
------------------------

Once you decide you want to contribute to phpDocumentor (which we really
appreciate!) you can fork the project at
http://github.com/phpDocumentor/phpDocumentor2.

Please do *not* develop your contribution on your master branch but
create a separate feature branch from the ``develop`` branch for each feature
that you  want to contribute.

Not doing so means that if you decide to work on two separate
features and place a pull request for one of them, that the changes
of the other issue that you are working on is also submitted. Even
if it is not completely finished.

To get more information about the usage of Git, please refer to the
(ProGit online book)[http://progit.org/book/] written by Scott Chacon
and/or (this help page of Github)[http://learn.github.com/p/intro.html].

Coding Standards
----------------

PEAR Coding Standards
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

phpDocumentor uses the coding standards as defined by PEAR, which can be
found at http://pear.php.net/codingstandards.

It is adviced to check your code using \_PHP*CodeSniffer*; it
includes support for the PEAR coding standard by default. In the
root of the project is a script file called ``phpcs`` which
provides an example of usage.

Amendments
~~~~~~~~~~

@category, @packages and @subpackages and namespaces
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting with phpDocumentor 2.0.2a3 we have switched to PHP 5.3 as minimal
required version. This enables us to use namespaces for our packages.

As such all new code should not feature the @category, @package or @subpackage
tags but use namespaces to identify the type of code.

The following format is used:

.. code-block:: php

    \phpDocumentor\[Component]\[optional Subcomponent]

It is discouraged to go deeper than 3 levels but not prohibited.
Please refer to
(PSR-0)[https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md]
for a reference on the names for namespaces.

Unit testing
------------

phpDocumentor aims to be have at least 90% Code Coverage using unit tests
using PHPUnit. It is appreciated to include unit tests in your pull
requests as they also help understand what the contributed code
exactly does.
